 what challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes?

 I faced so many problems with the instagram and twitter logo fighting me on where they wanted to be on my page I almost had to rebuild everything to get it right
 because I didnt format it right the first time.Also the blackoveraly aka the mask took me a bit to get right because I had to look around the internet on how too pull it off since 
 I have never done it in the past. But overall I think this Showed me how great bootstrap is and how much time it can save once you really get going it makes formating images and the scaling of the site so much easier.
