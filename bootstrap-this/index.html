                <p class="lead">Bootstrap is used to create responsive websites without any use of CSS, it's like a giant libary of css that uses javascript to do the work without you even knowning 
                    it. But just remember just like css you should work on mobile first and with bootstrap its even easier with its awesome powerful mobile-first flex grid to build layouts of
                    all shaps and sizes. with all this power how could anything go wrong ?.</p>
                  <!-- The my-4 is to put the line that is inbetween the paragrah and the button which makes it have more space and look cleaner-->

                        First things first you need to open your coding software I use visual studio code. Then make a new page called it index.html from there you will need to link the bootstrap
                        so go to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ and there under CSS you will find a 'link' which you will fit nicely into your head as a link.
                        After this your ready to get Bootstraping !

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once you have done the linking your ready to get going to the races. the best way to start off is cover your mobile-first. Because bootstrap covers girnds and flex 
                      very well which makes it easier  to scale up elements and optimize them for in all screen sizes. once you have made sure everything is up scaling the way you want you 
                      can add all the flare you want.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="row"> 
                    <div class="py-3 col-md-6">
                        <h3>Where do I learn about the docmentation ?</h3>
                        <p class="d-inline-block" >
                            you can learn about all the docmentation of bootsrap thru their main page using the same link https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
                            for example I built this whole website using only bootstrap and followed and learned by looking thru the website for the info I needed. for example here is a
                            card!
                        </p>

                    <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
                  <div class="card-body bg-secondary">
                  <h5 class="card-title">This is a Card I made </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">following simple info and you too can make a card like this and take this fancy little button !</p>
                  <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Click me</a>
                  </div>
                  </div>
                        
                      </div>
                      
                      <div class="py-3 col-md-6">
                        <h3>Who made BootStrap?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton are the developers of Bootstrap story goes that they both worked at Twitter and were looking for ways
                             as a means of improving the tools used on the make  website and reducing maintenance time and making it easier overall.
