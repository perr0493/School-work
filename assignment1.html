        <p>Hello fellow <abbr title="Interactive Media design students">IMDS</abbr>
           my name is Derek Perreault and I am excited 
           to be in this class to improve on my skills
           of html and to learn more about the field. 
           I have some experience with html and css from my
           last year study's but I know I am not pro and 
           would love to get better at it! I hope from this 
           class I can grow my skills in it so it can become
           a second hand skill to me.  </p>
