        <p>Hello fellow <abbr title="Interactive Media design students">IMDS</abbr>
           my name is Derek Perreault .I would say
           I am a pretty creative person in the way that I enjoy art 
           and lots of forms of media on a personal note. I love 
           tattoos and that is the reason I already have some and 
           would love to get more and I am a big fan of fashion and 
           just looking nice for myself. and I am excited 
           to be in this class to improve on my skills
           of html and to learn more about the field I have some experience with
           html and css from my last year study's but I know I am not a
           pro and would love to get better at it! I hope from this 
           class I can grow my skills in it so it can become
           a second hand skill to me. </p>
